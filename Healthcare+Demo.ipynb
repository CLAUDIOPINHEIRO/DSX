    "# Healthcare Python Streaming Application Demo\n",
    "\n",
    "This Python notebook shows how to create an app with Python that ingests and analyzes streaming data from a feed, and then visualizes the data in a notebook. You submit this app to be built in the Streaming Analytics service in IBM Bluemix. \n",
    "\n",
    "To create the app, you use the <a href=\"http://ibmstreams.github.io/streamsx.documentation//docs/python/1.6/python-appapi-devguide/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">IBM Streams Python API</a>. The API is provided in the streamsx package, which is integrated in DSX. You also use the API to access data streams from views defined in the app once it's running on the Streaming Analytics service.\n",
    "\n",
    "The app subscribes to the *ingest-physionet* topic (<a href=\"https://www.physionet.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Physionet database</a>) containing the patient data, performs analysis on the patient data to calculate vital data for all patients, and finally creates a view for displaying the results in this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Submitting the Python app from the notebook to the Streaming Analytics service allows data to be retrieved from the view server. Once the data has been retrieved, it can be analyzed, manipulated, or visualized like any other data accessed from a notebook. In the case of this demo, waveform graphs and numerical widgets display the healthcare data of the patient.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook runs in a **Python 3.5** environment. You should be familiar with Python and <a href=\"http://datascience.ibm.com/docs/content/getting-started/quick-overview.html#notebooks\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Jupyter Notebooks</a>. This notebook also assumes that you are familiar with medical terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tip:** If you leave the notebook or the output or prompts are not displayed after running a cell, click **Kernel -> Restart** on the menu bar to rerun the cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following diagram outlines the architecture of this demo. This notebook provides a pre-compiled IBM Streams application to simulate patient data, and publish the data to a topic shown in the **Ingest** box. The patient data is submitted to the ingest-physionet topic so that the data feed can be consumed by the app you're going to build later in this notebook. When running the cells of this notebook, you are creating the information shown in the **Analytics** and **Visualization** boxes of the diagram.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='https://github.com/IBMStreams/streamsx.health/blob/develop/samples/HealthcareJupyterDemo/images/architecture_diagram.jpg?raw=true' alt=\"Demo Architecture\" title=\"Demo Architecture\"></img>\n",
    "\n",
    "The data shown in the **Ingest** box of the diagram is obtained and processed for you to monitor and analyze the information in the **Visualization** box. The waveform data is shown in the graphs and numerical data is displayed in the black boxes. The **Poincare plot** graph above the black boxes analyzes the interval of the heartbeat's R wave to the next R wave (RR). The R wave is an upward deflection that is easily identified in the ECG. The R peak is the maximum amplitude of the R wave. This data is aggregated and continuously updated using the Streaming Analytics service.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, you can create a view object to connect the Python app to the view server. The **Streams View Server** shown in the **Analytics** box is the view function in the code which defines how Python can receive data from the view server. \n",
    "Each blue box is an operator in a Streams app. The operator then analyzes the data (tuples), sends it to the view server and to the downstream app. As a result, the live stream can be pulled as the data is being analyzed. The up arrow in the diagram indicates notebook requests to connect to the view server to receive data from a particular view. The down arrow retrieves the data to present it in the notebook as rendered graphics or visualizations.\n"
