    "# Connect to dashDB and DB2 using Scala\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook shows how to access dashDB Data Warehouse (or a DB2 database) using Scala by following the steps below:\n",
    "1. Import the JDBC library\n",
    "1. Identify and enter the database connection credentials\n",
    "1. Create the database connection\n",
    "1. Query the data\n",
    "1. Close the database connection\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is dashDB ?\n",
    "\n",
    "**dashDB** is a fully managed cloud data warehouse, purpose-built for analytics. It offers massively parallel processing (MPP) scale, and compatibility with a wide range of business intelligence (BI) tools.  \n",

    "</a> \n",
    "\n",
    "## Import the JDBC library\n",
    "Scala code gets compiled into byte code that runs on a Java™ virtual machine (JVM), which allows Scala applications to directly call Java libraries. Therefore, accessing dashDB from a Scala application is simply a matter of using the existing JDBC driver for DB2: the IBM Data Server Driver for JDBC and SQLJ."
